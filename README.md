# (Match) Maker

## Proposed Level of Achievement
Apollo 11

Done by: Hung Eu Leon & Lai Yuen Sheng

## Motivation
Lost touch with your favorite sports due to the lack of fellow hobbyists — or “kakis”? Want to meet new people who share your sport interests?

COVID-19 has made it especially difficult for us to make new friends in NUS, and even more difficult for us to find our “kakis” to engage in sports with. Your current friends may not share your hobby or may be busy with their own commitments. With social activities curtailed, many students don’t have many opportunities to build connections in university, much less meet people with similar interests.

The issue is even more amplified when we consider the difficulty of finding people of similar skill level — games often become less enjoyable when there is a significant skills mismatch.

## Aim
We hope to be a convenient and accessible intermediary platform where sports matches are set up for people based on sports interests and skill levels, ultimately motivating the pursuance of sports.

## User Stories
1. Sports enthusiasts on our platform will be able to set up/find games within NUS based on defined parameters (ie. sports interests and skill levels)
2. Students who wish to pick up a new sport will be able to find fellow beginners to play with them. They may also chance upon experienced players who are willing to impart their knowledge.
3. Professors and teaching assistants on our platform can forge stronger bonds with students through participating in sports activities.
4. Administrators should be able to identify users guilty of “no-show” or verbal abuse in the in-built chat function, warn them or even ban them if they continue to be disruptive.

## Differences from Existing Platforms
| (Match) Maker | Resource Booking System (REBOKS) |
| --- | --- |
| Users can either invite their friends or book the facilities and allow other interested users they may not know of to join their game | Users have to find players through their own means, be it a friend or an acquaintance |
| Users can interact and meet other players who they do not have prior any connections with by creating or joining games | Conventionally, users will usually find friends or acquaintances to play with them, meeting new people is a rare occasion |
| Users can expect to be reminded of their upcoming matches as they subscribe to the Telegram bot | Users will have to remember their own bookings by themselves |
